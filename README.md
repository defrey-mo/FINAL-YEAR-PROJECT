STUDENT MISCONDUCT AND BEHAVIOUR SYSTEM

Our project is to design, develop and implement a centralized system that will enable seamless sharing of students' conduct record 
especially when students are moving from one school so that students with indiscipline issues can be accountable.
The system will also help school administrators to make timely/informed decisions before admitting a student to the school.
It will also help to keep the students discipline in check always which also promote discipline among students.


## üìÇ Features of our project
- Feature 1: Secure Login: Every school registered has a secure login that has promoted privacy in a way that information of school A cannot be seen by school B

- Feature 2: Students' Registration: The system also allows students to be registered with respective schools and uniquely assigning each student with a unique
  learners identity number (LIN).

- Feature 3: Students conduct updating: This feature allows the updation of the students conduct which facilitates the real-time updating.
  
- Feature 4: Report generation: After checking the students by inputting the unique learners identity number (LIN) a report is generated to show all the students
  record.
