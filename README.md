# Students' Misconduct and Behaviour System

The **Students' Misconduct and Behaviour System** is a web-based platform designed to assist schools in Uganda (and beyond) to efficiently manage and track student discipline records. 
The system enables schools to log, retrieve, and monitor student conduct such as absenteeism, bullying, academic dishonesty, drug use, and other behavioral issues.

The goal is to replace traditional, error-prone paper-based systems with a centralized and secure platform that supports accountability, improves data accuracy, and provides better communication between school staff and administrators.
